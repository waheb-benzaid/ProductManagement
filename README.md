Hi, this is Waheb with a small description of Product Management Api.

## Tech Stack

1- Nodejs with NestJS framework
2- MongoDB as database
3- Postman for APIs documentation


## Project setup

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

```

## Database

The used database is MongoDb

If you are using Linux, you should start MongoDB by typing in the terminal :

```bash
#Open terminal and type
mongod

```
## .env

Add .env file in the root of the project and put your Mongo db URI


## API Documentation

I shared the Postman Collection via Email, you access it.
